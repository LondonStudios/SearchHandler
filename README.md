# London Studios - Update
Since forming London Studios in April 2020 we've created a number of **high quality** and **premium** resources for the FiveM project, focusing on the emergency services and aiming to bring your server to the next level.

Although we made a number of free resources such as this one in the first year, we've now switched to creating paid content, keeping them constantly updated and working along with providing the best possible support to our customers.

Our **most popular** resources now include *Smart Fires, Police Grappler* and *Smart Hose*.

With **thousands** of **happy customers** we are confident you'll love our resources and our active support team are on hand to help if you have any questions!

# Our store: https://store.londonstudios.net/github
# Our discord: https://discord.gg/nC2krpN

Therefore, this resource is now likely *out of date* and is *no longer supported by us*. The full source code is available should you wish to make any changes. All of our paid resources however are constantly updated and we invite you to take a look!

# SearchHandler - London Studios
This plugin is designed to enhance the player search experience for your FiveM server, a simple resource allowing players to set their inventory and be searched by other players. The player performing the search must be within a close proximity or they will be unable to search!

This plugin is made by LondonStudios, we have created a range of other plugins to enhance the roleplay experience including TaserFramework, ActivateAlarm, Policing Handbook & more in the future!.

You can now buy me a coffee [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/londonstudios).
## Usage
**/setinv [inventory]** - This sets your inventory prior to the search.
Example usage: /setinv Phone, Money, Drugs

**/search** - This searches the nearest player.

## Installation
1. Create a new resource folder on your server.
2. Add "Client.net.dll", "Server.net.dll", fxmanifest.lua to the resource folder.
3. In server.cfg, "ensure" SearchHandler.

If you have an outdated CitizenFX server you will require a __resource.lua, we can create this for you on our Discord, or follow the FiveM documentation to create this yourself.

## Feedback
We appreciate feedback, bugs and suggestions related to SearchHandler and future plugins. We hope you enjoy using the resource and look forward to hearing from people!
