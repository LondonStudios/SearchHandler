# SearchHandler - London Studios
This plugin is designed to enhance the player search experience for your FiveM server, a simple resource allowing players to set their inventory and be searched by other players. The player performing the search must be within a close proximity or they will be unable to search!

## Usage
**/setinv [inventory]** - This sets your inventory prior to the search.
Example usage: /setinv Phone, Money, Drugs

**/search** - This searches the nearest player.

## Installation
1. Create a new resource folder on your server.
2. Add "Client.net.dll", "Server.net.dll", fxmanifest.lua to the resource folder.
3. In server.cfg, "ensure" SearchHandler.

If you have an outdated CitizenFX server you will require a __resource.lua, we can create this for you on our Discord, or follow the FiveM documentation to create this yourself.

## Feedback
We appreciate feedback, bugs and suggestions related to SearchHandler and future plugins. We hope you enjoy using the resource and look forward to hearing from people!
